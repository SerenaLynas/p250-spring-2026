    "### Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already seen how to index elements in an array.\n",
    "Array indices start at zero, whether this seems strange or the obvious choice depends on how you think about arrays and the programming languages you have used.\n",
    "If you are familiar with pointers or references, then this is the obvious choice.\n",
    "Consider the array `a = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]`.\n",
    "In Python (and C and related languages) if we construct such an array, for example as `a = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)`, then we can think of `a` as pointing to the beginning of the array.\n",
    "Thus `a[0]` represents moving the pointer zero elements along the array, `a[1]` as moving the pointer one element along the array, and in general `a[j]` as moving `j` elements along the array.\n",
    "Thinking of it this way we see that `a[2]` is two steps along the array so it contains the value `0.5`.\n",
    "On the other hand, this choice can seem confusing in the sense that `a[2]` is the *third element* in the array, not the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, this choice makes it easy to understand what it means to step backwards in an array.\n",
    "In particular `a[-1]` represents stepping one element backwards from the beginning of the array with the extra fact that we *wrap around* the array, so that we end up at the last element in it.\n",
    "We can then understand what any backwards step, `a[-j]`, means.\n",
    "For the example above this means that `a[-3]` is the same as `a[2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this way of picturing negative indexing is nice, we should be careful not to push it to far.\n",
    "An array is not cyclic (it is not periodic).\n",
    "We *can* walk off the end or beginning of the array.\n",
    "Thus in the example above, `a[j]` is **not defined** for $j\\ge 5$ nor $j<-5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas extend to two dimensional arrays.\n",
    "For a two dimensional array, `M`, then `M[i,j]` is the element from *row* `i` and *column* `j`.\n",
    "Again, both of these index values start from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that you are comfortable accessing elements of an array.\n",
    "Feel free to generate arrays and play with pulling out specific elements of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "###     Array Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Array slicing is discussed in detail in Sections 2.2 and 3.4 of the *Guide to Numpy* (see the course syllabus for a link).\n",
    "We will only need basic slicing and will study some simple cases here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "The index we use to access elements of an array need not just be a single number.\n",
    "The generic structure is `[start:end:step]`.\n",
    "This will give a view of the array starting at index `start` and proceeding up to, *but not including*, index `end` in steps of `step`.\n",
    "We can leave out any of the values and use the defaults instead.\n",
    "The default for `start` is the first index (zero), the default for `end` is the length of the array, and the default for `step` is one.\n",
    "This means there are many ways to reference the whole array.\n",
    "Let `a` be a one dimensional array, then all the following are equivalent: `a`, `a[:]`, `a[::]`, `a[0:len(a)]`, `a[0:len(a):]`, `a[0::1]`, and `a[0:len(a):1]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Array slicing is more than just a convenient way of viewing the data, it also allows us to *change* parts of the array.\n",
    "Technically, array slicing gives a *view* of the array.\n",
    "It **does not make a copy**, it really produces a \"smart pointer\" that allows us to examine and modify parts of an array.\n",
    "This is a very important and powerful feature.\n",
    "For the small arrays we will work with here it would not matter if we made copies, but if we were working with very large arrays this would be very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `a=np.arange(20)`.\n",
    "Use array slicing to print every third value of the array, that is, to print `a[0]`, `a[3]`, ...."
