    "\n",
    "In this lab we will solve a real problem which means we will encounter a number of side issues to distract us from our main task.\n",
    "We have already seen some of the issues in the prelab.\n",
    "Also, typically when doing calculations we want to avoid writing loops if we can help it since loops are cumbersome to write and slow to run.\n",
    "Array slicing is a powerful feature of `numpy` arrays that makes it possible to avoid writing loops in many cases.\n",
    "We will discuss array slicing in more detail in the future, for now we can use a simple form of it, as discussed below."

    "## Basic Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to find the angular velocity of the Earth as a function of time as it orbits the Sun.\n",
    "This does not sound too hard but is more involved than we may first think.\n",
    "To make things a little simpler we will only find the angular speed of the Earth, $\\mathrm{d}\\theta/\\mathrm{d}t \\equiv \\dot{\\theta}(t)$, not its direction.\n",
    "From Kepler’s second law we know that the angular speed in an elliptical orbit is not constant: the radius of the orbit sweeps out equal area in equal time.\n",
    "When we study central forces in classical mechanics we learn that this can be understood in terms of conservation of angular momentum and further that we can easily write down equations of motion and solve them in terms of integrals, giving expressions for how both the radial and angular position of an object behaves in such an orbit.\n",
    "We are interested in the angular position which for an elliptical orbit is given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  t(\\theta) &= \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi}(1-e^2)^{3/2} \\int_0^\\theta \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\theta'}{(1+e\\cos\\theta')^2} \\\\\n",
    "            &= \\frac{\\tau}{2\\pi}\\left[ 2\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1-e}{1+e}}\\tan(\\theta/2)\\right)\n",
    "                        - \\frac{e\\sqrt{1-e^2}\\sin\\theta}{1+e\\cos\\theta}\n",
    "                    \\right]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Here $\\tau$ is the period of the orbit, $0 \\leq e < 1$ is the eccentricity of the orbit, and I have chosen $t=0$ at periapsis (the distance of closest approach).\n",
    "The difficulty we encounter is not in doing the integral, that we **can** do, it is in inverting this function.\n",
    "We have written an equation for $t(\\theta)$ but we really want $\\theta(t)$.\n",
    "One approach to inverting this would be to do what we did in the previous lab: use a root finder.\n",
    "That is time consuming and not amenable to taking the derivative we will need.\n",
    "In this lab we will instead interpolate using a spline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation given above comes from a direct solution of the equations of motion.\n",
    "Historically this result has been manipulated in many ways.\n",
    "In fact, even before Newton’s laws were known this problem was studied observationally.\n",
    "An alternative approach to the problem is through **Kepler’s equation**:\n",
    "$$\\omega t = \\psi - e \\sin \\psi.$$\n",
    "Here $\\omega t$ is called the *mean anomaly* and $\\psi$ is called the *eccentric anomaly*.\n",
    "(Astronomers seem to like anomalies.)\n",
    "In this formula the *average speed* is given by $\\omega = 2\\pi/\\tau$ so that $0 \\leq \\omega t < 2\\pi$ for $0 \\leq \\psi \\leq 2\\pi$.\n",
    "The angle $\\psi$ can be related to the angular position of the Earth, $\\theta$, in many ways; we will use\n",
    "$$\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\cos\\psi-e}{1-e\\cos\\psi}.$$\n",
    "Note that in the pre-computer age over one hundred methods were developed to invert this equation.\n",
    "It drove the development of many numerical techniques."

    "## Basic Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually the procedure we want to follow is straightforward:\n",
    "1. Calculate $t(\\theta)$ for a grid of values using the two methods discussed above: (1) the first equation for $t(\\theta)$ and (2) Kepler's equation.\n",
    "2. Construct a spline that inverts these to give $\\theta(t)$.\n",
    "3. Calculate the angular velocity, $\\dot\\theta(t)$, by calculating the first derivative of our spline. Note that we can do this at any time, t, so we will do this on a finely spaced time grid.\n",
    "4. …\n",
    "4. Profit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally it will not be quite so easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only consider the motion of the Earth, but the approach works for any object in an elliptical orbit so all functions we write should be defined in terms of $e$ and $\\tau$ instead of explicitly plugging in numbers.\n",
    "Ultimately we do need numbers, for the Earth: $e=0.01671123$ and $\\tau=365.25636$ days.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, we are solving a real problem but in a simple way.\n",
    "If we were going to do this for a real research problem we would need to be more careful than we are here.\n",
    "We would want to perform more checks, consider more methods, ….\n",
    "In particular, we are not going to do a good job of exploring the accuracy of our methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end results of this work will be two plots.\n",
    "You should **always check your intermediate results** as you are developing your solution, even when these checks are not asked for or even suggested.\n",
    "This includes looking at arrays generated, producing quick plots, *etc*.\n",
    "You should remove these checks from your final notebook document.\n",

Suppose `tgrid` has length `N` (where `N` is even so we do not need to treat `N/2` as a special case). Then for some array `A` of the same length, `A[:N//2]` will represent the first half of the array `A` and `A[N//2:]` will represent the second half. We can do a lot of things with these slices, in particular we can assign to them! For example, `A[N//2:]=1` would assign `1` to the second half of the array and leave the first half unchanged.\n",

To fix this, we use the new division operator, `//`, that forces integer division, so `N//2` will do what we want. (This is mostly true, `//` has some other quirks that we have briefly mentioned in class but are irrelevant here.)\n",

    "Finally, as also noted in the prelab, `matplotlib` tries to show all the data you provide it.\n",
    "In the process of doing so it tries to guess reasonable limits for the axes; it does not always get this right.\n",
    "You should adjust these (and anything else) to improve the readability of the plot."

    "One reason for using two methods is that they **must** both produce the same result.\n",
