    "## A \"Real\" Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now take the first step toward creating a real plot. The default plots created by `matplotlib` are \"ok\", not great, but with a little effort we can make them very nice. We will work on this more throughout the semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will improve the plot we made above. The `rng.normal` function claims it picks random values from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. We will test this by plotting the histogram along with the expected curve for a Gaussian distribution. To do so we will proceed as follows. All code should be put in the following code cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate 10,000 random numbers using `rng.normal` as was done above. Store them in some variable (use whatever name you prefer).\n",
    "2. Find the minimum and maximum values from your array. Looking through such a long array by hand would not be a good use of your time, so naturally there are functions for doing this. Find some appropriate functions and use them. Print the minimum and maximum values using the `print` function. (Note: There are a number of ways to do this, you only need to find one.)\n",
    "3. When we generate a histogram using `hist` we can specify the binning in a few ways. In our original plot we told `hist` to use 1000 bins; it figured out how big to make them from the data we provided (and, in fact, returned this information). Alternatively, we can tell it what bins to use and we will do that here. Create an array of bin values in steps of 0.1 from some value smaller than the minimum in your array to some value larger than the maximum in your array. It makes sense to use \"simple\" numbers like 3.8 or 4.2 instead of an arbitrary real number. Store this array in some new variable.\n",
    "4. Use the array from the previous part as the bins for your histogram. As always, check the documentation of `hist` to learn how to do this. (You will notice that there is a `bins` keyword.) \n",
    "5. We would now like to plot the *expected* Gaussian on top of the histogram. A general Gaussian is given by\n",
    "$$ f(x,\\mu,\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\!\\left[ -\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\!\\right], $$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the mean and $\\sigma$ is the variance (width) of the Gaussian. Note: We want to use the *expected* values for $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ for the distribution used by `rng.normal`, **not values calculated from the random numbers**. That would be a different test. Unfortunately, if you plot this function along with the histogram they will not lie on top of each other correctly. (You should try this!) The problem is that this function is normalized, but our histogram was not. This is easy to fix. Once again look at the documentation for `hist` and notice that it has a `density` keyword. There are also many other options that may be useful. For example, I prefer to make histograms as steps instead of being filled. Feel free to explore some of these options.\n",
    "6. We are now ready to plot the Gaussian. To do this use the `plot` function. When you look up its documentation you will find it has many, many options. It is good to play with some of them. The most useful ones for now are those that allow us to change the color, style, and width of the line. (Hint: We also need to *calculate* the Gaussian. This uses functions like exponentiation and square roots and a constant, $\\pi$. Naturally there are functions defined to do these operations and the value of $\\pi$ is also available to us. In what module that we have already loaded would you expect them to be in? What do you expect them to be called? Often things will work out as we expect.)\n",
    "7. If you have performed the steps given above you now have a plot, but not a very useful plot. It contains a histogram and a line, but what are these things? What are we suppose to learn from the plot? There are a few things we should **always** do whenever we make a plot. We will have a more complete set of rules in the next lab but for now here are a few things to do to get us started:\n",
    "  1. **Required:** Label the axes. What is on the $x$ and $y$ axes in the plot? Without labels we have no idea. The labels on these axes should be descriptive so that at a quick glance we know what is being plotted. At this point you may be able to guess the names of the functions to use to label the axes. (Hint: Look up `xlabel`.  Also, remember that any function that comes from a module must be prefixed by that modules name. For plotting we have chosen to use the alias `plt` for the `pyplot` interface.)\n",
    "  2. **Required:** Title the figure. For this course you must **always** add a title to your figures. When a figure is included in a paper you write it has a caption so a title is not necessary (nor should be included), but for this course you must always include one. It should come as no surprise what function to use to create a title!\n",
    "  3. **Suggested:** Add minor tick marks. By default only the major tick marks (with tick labels) are created. A figure almost always looks better with smaller ticks in-between the larger ones. These can be turned on using `minorticks_on()`. We will see other ways to globally achieve such changes in the near future. I have much more to say about producing quality plots!\n",
    "8. Finally, put all of this together into a single code cell below that prints the minimum and maximum values and also produces the required plot."
